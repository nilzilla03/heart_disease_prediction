# heart_disease_prediction
Did this as part of coursework for the ML course in college. The code quality isn't great because of shortage of time. We essentially had to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python using only basic libraries like NumPy, Pandas etc. 
The models we decided to implement were Naive Bayes Classifier, Perceptron, Artificial Neural Networks, and Fisher's Linear Discriminant. I wrote the code for Naive Bayes Classifier using NumPy and Pandas. On our dataset, it gives an accuracy of around 83%.
